# oil_furnace_control
## Self-made oil furnaces have a lot of components that need to be controlled, oil pump, fan, heater, igniter, and flame sensor. There are many market positions: the original Siemens controllers, and some Chinese equivalent with obviously better price, none of these proposals have a heater control and fire control integrated into one sophisticated system, the user can’t manipulate the pre-purge time and the amount of retakes when flame went down we can’t control the energy use of furnace, oil use and can’t estimate the whole time when furnace was on, measure the time when heater works.
